# Mutual Funds Dashboard

Welcome to the **Mutual Funds Dashboard** – a showcase project designed to demonstrate modern frontend development skills, best practices, and a keen eye for user experience.

## 🚀 Technologies Demonstrated

- **React**  
  Harnessing the power of React, this dashboard delivers a highly responsive, component-driven interface. The architecture is modular, maintainable, and built for scalability.

- **React Router**  
  Dynamic, client-side routing ensures seamless navigation between pages. Users can explore their funds, add new ones, and view detailed reports without ever leaving the app context.

- **TypeScript**  
  Type safety is paramount. TypeScript is used throughout the codebase to catch errors early, enforce robust interfaces, and enable confident refactoring.

## 🗂️ Pages & Features

- **Dashboard (`/`)**  
  Lists all your mutual funds in a clear, organized view. Demonstrates data mapping, conditional rendering, and state management.

- **Create Fund (`/create-fund`)**  
  A form-driven page for adding new funds. Highlights controlled components, validation, and user feedback.

- **View Fund (`/view-fund/:fundName`)**  
  Displays detailed information about a specific fund. Showcases dynamic routing, parameter handling, and data-driven UI.

## 📊 Sample Data

For demonstration purposes, sample mutual fund data is provided in  
`public/sample-funds.json`.  
The dashboard loads and displays this data so you can explore all features without any setup.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).
